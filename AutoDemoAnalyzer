# AutoDemoAnalyzer Version 2
# READ BELOW BEFORE USING SCRIPT

# this code can be ran as part of a MAC-autostart script, or on its own.
# if you aren't sure, you should probably run this in independent mode.

# the demo analyzer can be found at https://github.com/MegaAntiCheat/analysis-template-rust, do not use the /demolyzer repository
# make sure that you have analyzed a demofile before, so that it generates the cli.exe file

# NOTICE: independent mode is the only one currently implemented, the others will be when I have the time

# if you wish to run this in independant mode (without an autostart script): 
    # run the script when booting up the game (or at any point before starting to record any demos)

# if you are using my AutostartAnticheat.py script: 
    # place this script in the same directory as that script, and then run that script to start the game

# if you wish to use this as part of your own (python) autostart script:
    # place this script in the same directory as your autostart script
    # at the top of your script, put `from time import time` 
    # in your autostart script, after it has started the game, put `gamestarttime = time()`
    # at the end of your autostart script, (after it has closed the game) run it with `import AutoDemoAnalyzer` followed by `AutoDemoAnalyzer.analyze(gamestarttime)`

# regardless of what method you use, you will also need to set the following variables:

# set this to the path of your demo analyzer folder:
analyzerpath = '' # example: `analyzerpath = 'E:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/analysis-template-rust-main'`
# set this to the path of your TF2 demos folder:
demospath = '' # example: `demospath = 'E:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/demos'`
# optional arguments to be passed to the analyzer, leave blank to just scan the demo with default settings:
arguments = '' # example: `arguments = '-a the_best_algorithm -p'`

# beyond this point is the actual code, you can finish reading here



# importing stuff isn't always necessary, but I don't know what is in your autostart script
from time import time, sleep # for getting the current unix epoch and for waiting, respectively
import psutil # for checking if tf2 has closed (only used in independant mode)

            list_of_files.remove(latest_demo) # remove the demo from the previous list, so that we don't keep adding the same demo over and over
