# AutostartMAC
AutostartMAC itself is nearly finished, but for now you will have to set the client_backend.exe and index.html (gui) paths manually. AutoDemoAnalyzer is finished.

Make sure you read the comments at the top of whichever files you use, as they contain additional information on how to run the programs.

Includes an optional addon, AutoDemoAnalyzer, which can be run standalone or as a part of the main program.
